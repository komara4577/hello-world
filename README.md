Intro to GitHub

Hey everyone!

I thought trying this GitHub thing would be the best way to interact with the coding world while learning new and exciting programs. Instead of keeping everything I've learned to myself I think this would be the best route!

If you have any code you think is interesting please share! Or if you have a good dad joke please don't hold back.
